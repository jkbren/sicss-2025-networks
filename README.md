# Network Science, Network Visualization, and Pyhton -- SICSS Stanford 2025
This repository contains materials for the guest lecture at [SICSS Stanford 2025](https://sicss.io/2025/stanford/people) on Network Science and Network Visualization using Python.


### 1. "I'm not that experienced with git and python."

Not quite sure what "clone the repo" means? Here's what to do:

0. Do you have a folder on your computer where you usually code in? Great! If not, go ahead and create a `CODE` folder on your desktop. We will be working here for this tutorial.

1. Open up a terminal window and navigate to the folder where you expect to do your coding (in this example "CODE") `cd ~/Desktop/CODE/`

2. Clone the repository: `git clone git clone https://github.com/jkbren/sicss-networks-tutorial`

3. Navigate into the repository: `cd sicss-networks-tutorial`

4. Install the software: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Start up the jupyter notebook! `jupyter notebook`

### 2. "I'm comfortable with git and python."

To install the software for this tutorial, clone the repo and run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/jkbren/sicss-networks-tutorial
cd sicss-networks-tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
